                    <h1>Internet Security</h1>
                    <p>Internet security is a branch of computer security specifically related to not only Internet, often involving browser security and the World Wide Web,[citation needed] but also network security as it applies to other applications or operating systems as a whole. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet.[1] The Internet represents an insecure channel for exchanging information, which leads to a high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing,[2] online viruses, trojans, worms and more.
                    <h2>Difference Between Passive And active Security Threats</h2>
                    <p>Passive security threats that refers to eavesdropping or data monitoring where the attackers just monitor the information that are being relayed between sender and receiver.
                    <p>Active security threats refer to Man-In-The-Middle attack, Denial of service attacks where attacker exploits the information and may change the contents.
                    <p> List and briefly define categories of security services:
                    <ul>
                    <li> <underline> Authentication <underline>:Services that checks if the end user is legitimate or performs peer entity authentication and data origin authentication to check if the origin of data is legitimate.
                    <li> <underline> Access Control Data <underline>:Provides the protection against unauthorized use and modification of data 
                    <li> <underline> Confidentiality <underline>:Provides data security from unknown unauthorized access
                    <li> <underline> Nonrepudiation <underline>:Provides proof of origin and delivery of data so that both sender and receiver cannot deny of the data transmission 
                    <li> <underline> Availability Service <underline>:Service that ensure that data and resources are available for authorised end users
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Malware</h1>
                    <p>A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. It will use this machine as a host to scan and infect other computers. When these new worm-invaded computers are controlled, the worm will continue to scan and infect other computers using these computers as hosts, and this behaviour will continue.Computer worms use recursive methods to copy themselves without host programs and distribute themselves based on the law of exponential growth, thus controlling and infecting more and more computers in a short time. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.
                    <p>A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system.
                    <p>A computer virus, much like a flu virus, is designed to spread from host to host and has the ability to replicate itself. Similarly, in the same way that flu viruses cannot reproduce without a host cell, computer viruses cannot reproduce and spread without programming such as a file or document.
                    <p>Spyware is the term given to a category of software which aims to steal personal or organisational information. It is done by performing a set of operations without appropriate user permissions, sometimes even covertly. General actions a spyware performs include advertising, collection of personal information and changing user configuration settings of the computer
                    <h2>Software And Hardware To Protect Networks</h2>
                    <p>Software is a collection of instructions and data that tell a computer how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, including programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
                    <p>Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard. Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.
                    <p>Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of programming code installed on your computer's hard drive. In other words, hardware is a product you can hold in your hand, whereas software cannot be held in your hand. You can touch hardware, but you cannot touch software. Hardware is physical, and software is virtual.For example, the computer monitor you are using to read this text, and the mouse you are using to navigate this web page are computer hardware. The Internet browser allowing you to view this page, and the operating system that the browser is running on are considered software. A video card is hardware, and a computer game is software. You can touch and feel the video card, and the computer uses it to play a computer game, but you cannot touch or feel the programming code that makes up the computer game
                    <h3>Network Protocols</h1>
                    <ul>
                    <li> <underline> SSL<underline>:Stands for "Secure Sockets Layer." SSL is a secure protocol developed for sending information securely over the Internet. Many websites use SSL for secure areas of their sites, such as user account pages and online checkout. Usually, when you are asked to "log in" on a website, the resulting page is secured by SSL..
                    <li> <underline> HTTPS<underline>:Stands for "HyperText Transport Protocol Secure." HTTPS is the same thing as HTTP, but uses a secure socket layer (SSL) for security purposes. Some examples of sites that use HTTPS include banking and investment websites, e-commerce websites, and most websites that require you to log in
                    <li> <underline> IPv6<underline>:Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4. In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF, who subsequently ratified it as an Internet Standard on 14 July 2017.
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Digital Certificates And Certificate Authorities</h2>
                    <p>A digital certificate, also known as a public key certificate, is used to cryptographically link ownership of a public key with the entity that owns it. Digital certificates are for sharing public keys to be used for encryption and authentication. Digital certificates include the public key being certified, identifying information about the entity that owns the public key, metadata relating to the digital certificate and a digital signature of the public key created by the issuer of the certificate.
                    <p> In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key. A CA acts as a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate. The format of these certificates is specified by the X.509 or EMV standard.
